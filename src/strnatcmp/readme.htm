<h1>Natural Order String Comparison</h1>
<p>by <a href="http://sourcefrog.net/">Martin Pool</a>

</p><p>Computer string sorting algorithms generally don't order strings
containing numbers in the same way that a human would do.  Consider:

</p><blockquote><pre>rfc1.txt
rfc2086.txt
rfc822.txt
</pre></blockquote>
<p>It would be more friendly if the program listed the files as

</p><blockquote><pre>rfc1.txt
rfc822.txt
rfc2086.txt
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Filenames sort properly if people insert leading zeros, but they
don't always do that.

</p><p>I've written a subroutine that compares strings according to this
natural ordering.  You can use this routine in your own software, or
download a patch to add it to your favourite Unix program.


</p><h2>Sorting</h2>

<p>Strings are sorted as usual, except that decimal integer substrings
are compared on their numeric value.  For example,

</p><blockquote>
   a &lt; a0 &lt; a1 &lt; a1a &lt; a1b &lt; a2 &lt; a10 &lt; a20
</blockquote>

<p>Strings can contain several number parts:

</p><blockquote>
  x2-g8 &lt; x2-y7 &lt; x2-y08 &lt; x8-y8
</blockquote>

in which case numeric fields are separated by nonnumeric characters.
Leading spaces are ignored.  This works very well for IP addresses
from log files, for example.

<p>
Leading zeros are <u>not</u> ignored, which tends to give more
reasonable results on decimal fractions.  
</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      1.001 &lt; 1.002 &lt; 1.010 &lt; 1.02 &lt; 1.1 &lt; 1.3
    </blockquote>

<p>Some applications may wish to change this by modifying the test
      that calls <code>isspace</code>.
    

    </p><p>
      Performance is linear: each character of the string is scanned
      at most once, and only as many characters as necessary to decide
      are considered.

      POSIX sort(1) has the -n option to sort numbers, but this doesn't
      work if there is a non-numeric prefix.

  <h2>To Do</h2>

  <p>
    Comparison of characters is purely numeric, without taking
    character set or locale into account.  So it is only correct for
    ASCII.  This should probably be a separate function because doing
    the comparisons will probably introduce a dependency on the OS
    mechanism for finding the locale and comparing characters.


  </p><p>
    It might be good to support multibyte character sets too.

  </p><p>
    If you fix either of these, please mail me.  They should not be
    very hard.
